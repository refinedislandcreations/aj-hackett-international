   description: Enjoy the thrill of the Souleuvre Valley in Normandie with Skypark Normandie by AJ Hackett! The first jumps took place in November 1990, after six months of hard work, and the Souleuvre Viaduct now gives adrenaline-seekers in Normandie the chance to get their thrills! In particular, with the opening of the giant zip line in 1999, the Glass Skycube offering a panoramic view of the entire Souleuvre Valley in 2022, and the new feature in 2024—the pendulum jump called Skyrope. Since then, the company's primary objective has been to protect the Souleuvre Valley (over 1,000 hectares) by giving it protected status while making it a major European tourist destination for everyone, from thrill-seekers to nature lovers.
